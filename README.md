This is simple data set of US superstore from 2014-2018.

 Utilized pyod library for outlier detection on Superstore dataset using univariate/bivariate detection, Isolation forest, KNN, and Cluster-based Local Outlier Factor (CBLOF). Furthermore, implemented an NN autoencoder model using tensorflow/keras for fraud detection. Achieve a ROC (Receiver Operating Characteristic) of 95%.
